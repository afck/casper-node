# casperlabs-node

This is the core application for the CasperLabs blockchain.

## Running a validator node

### Setup

Before running a node, prepare your Rust build environment, and build the required system smart contracts:

```
make setup-rs
make build-system-contracts -j
```

#### Containerized Setup

Add a file `.env` in project folder. An example is available under `env.example`.

Build and run docker image:
```
docker network create casperlabs
docker-compose build
docker-compose up
```


### Running

To run a validator node with the [local configuration options](resources/local/config.toml):

```
cargo run --release -- validator -c=resources/local/config.toml
```

It is likely that the configuration requires editing however, so typically one will want to generate a configuration
file first, edit it and then run:

```
cargo run --release -- generate-config > config.toml
# ... edit config.toml
cargo run --release -- validator -c=config.toml
```

Note that all paths specified in the config file must be absolute paths or relative to the config file itself.

It is also possible to specify individual config file options from the command line using one or more args in the form
of `-C=<SECTION>.<KEY>=<VALUE>`.  These will override values set in a config file if provided, or will override the
default values otherwise.

```
cargo run --release -- validator -c=resources/local/config.toml -C=consensus.secret_key_path=secret_keys/node-1.pem
```

**NOTE:** If you want to run multiple instances on the same machine, ensure you modify the `[storage.path]` field of
their configuration files to give each a unique path, or else instances will share database files.

As well as the commented [local config file](resources/local/config.toml), there is a commented
[local chainspec](resources/local/chainspec.toml) in the same folder.

## Logging

Logging can be enabled by setting the environment variable `RUST_LOG`.  This can be set to one of the following levels,
from lowest priority to highest: `trace`, `debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error`:

```
RUST_LOG=info cargo run --release -- validator -c=resources/local/config.toml
```

If the environment variable is unset, it is equivalent to setting `RUST_LOG=error`.

#### Log message format

A typical log message will look like:

```
Jun 09 01:40:17.315 INFO  [casperlabs_node::components::api_server api_server.rs:127] starting HTTP server; server_addr=127.0.0.1:7777
```

This is comprised of the following parts:
* timestamp
* log level
* full module path (not to be confused with filesystem path) of the source of the message
* filename and line number of the source of the message
* message

#### Filtering log messages

`RUST_LOG` can be set to enable varying levels for different modules.  Simply set it to a comma-separated list of
`module-path=level`, where the module path is as shown above in the typical log message, with the end truncated to suit.

For example, to enable `trace` level logging for the `small_network` module in `components`, `info` level for all other
modules in `components`, and `warn` level for the remaining codebase:

```
RUST_LOG=casperlabs_node::components::small=trace,casperlabs_node::comp=info,warn
```

## Running a client

See [the client README](client/README.md).
